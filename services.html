<h3>Acclimation & Care</h3>
<main>
  <p>Proper acclimation is crucial for the health of your new coral. We recommend the following steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Float the coral bag in your aquarium for 15-20 minutes to equalize temperature.</li>
    <li>Open the bag and slowly add small amounts of aquarium water to the bag over the course of an hour. If possible utilize a drip acclimation device and maintain 2-3 drops per second.</li>
    <li>Use a net to transfer the coral to your aquarium, discarding the bag water.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>For ongoing care, ensure your coral is placed in an appropriate location with suitable lighting and water flow. Adjust placement as coral acclimates to lighting and tank conditions. Regularly test your water parameters and perform maintenance as needed.</p>
